What is it?
-----------

Quantum Walk Simulator is a program coded in Java
that use Apache Hadoop to execute a Quantum
Walk simulation.


Apache Hadoop and Java Version notes
------------------------------------

The Quantum Walk Simulator supports JDK 1.6 or
higher and Apache Hadoop version 1.2 or higher.
Note that we have currently tested this
implementation with JDK 1.7 and Apache Hadoop
1.2.1.


Input format
------------

The input files must have a header and other
lines with the data. The format is:

-Header:
#TYPE,M,N
    where:
        -TYPE: A or B. A is the left matrix. B is
               the right matrix.
        -M and N: The dimensions of the matrices.
                  A vector must have a column
                  matrix format: #TYPE,M,1

-Other lines:
TYPE,M,N,REALjIMAGINARY
    where:
        -TYPE: A or B. A is the left matrix. B is
               the right matString absSquare;
        String reshape;
        String pdf;rix.
        -M and N: The row and column value. A
                  vector must have a column
                  matrix format: TYPE,M,0
        -REAL and IMAGINARY: The real and the
                             imaginary value for
                             each element of the
                             matrix. The
                             character "j" is the
                             separator used in
                             the code.
