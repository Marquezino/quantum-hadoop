What is it?
-----------

Quantum Walk Simulator is a program coded in Java
that use Apache Hadoop to execute a Quantum
Walk simulation.


Apache Hadoop and Java Version notes
------------------------------------

The Quantum Walk Simulator supports JDK 1.6 or
higher and Apache Hadoop version 1.2 or higher.
Note that we have currently tested this
implementation with JDK 1.7 and Apache Hadoop
1.2.1.


Parameters
----------

In the QWS.java file the user can change the
value of the variable STEPS, FILES, WORK_DIR,
JAR_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR.

-STEPS: The number of steps that will be executed
	in the simulation.

-FILES: The path of the file that contains the
	paths to the files of all matrices U and
	the vector psi. The order matter. Should
	be: U_0,U_1,...,U_n,psi. One per line.

-WORK_DIR: The path in the HDFS where the program
	will store the data. 

-JAR_DIR: The folder path where the .jar files
	are stored.

-OUTPUT_DIR: The folder path where the result
	will be stored. Should be a empty folder
	because this ALL DATA will be deleted.


Compile and run

environment variable HADOOP_CLASSPATH.

Open the Terminal and go to the location where
the folder src is stored. Now, execute the follow
commands:
