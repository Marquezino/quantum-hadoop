Operations Version 1.0 2015-05-23


What is it?
-----------

Operations is a pack of programs coded in Java
that use Apache Hadoop to execute a specific
operation.


Apache Hadoop and Java Version notes
------------------------------------

The Quantum Walk Simulator supports JDK 1.6 or
higher and Apache Hadoop version 1.2 or higher.
Note that we have currently tested this
implementation with JDK 1.7 and Apache Hadoop
1.2.1.


Parameters
----------

To run the operations, you will need same
parameters:

-HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER: The directory in the HDFS
	where are the input files.

-HDFS_TEMPORARY_FOLDER: A path to a absent
	ditectory in the HDFS. It will be deleted
	in the end of execution.

-HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER: A path to a absent
	ditectory in the HDFS. The program will store
	the result here. 

-TYPE_OF_MATRIX: If is the left matrix (A) or the
	right matrix (B).


Compile and run
---------------

To compile the code you need to know the folder
path where the Apache Hadoop was installed.
Change HADOOP_DIR for the right path.

Open the Terminal and go to the folder where
MultMatrix.java, KronMatrix.java and
NormMatrix.java are stored. Now, execute the follow
commands:

mkdir mult_class
javac -cp /home/hduser/hadoop/*:/home/hduser/hadoop/lib/* -d mult_class/ \
MultMatrix.java KronMatrix.java NormMatrix.java
jar -cvf mult.jar -C mult_class/ .

To run execute the follow command:

Matrix Multiplication
hadoop jar mult.jar mult.MultMatrix HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER HDFS_TEMPORARY_FOLDER HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER TYPE_OF_MATRIX

Kronecker Product
hadoop jar mult.jar mult.KronMatrix HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER TYPE_OF_MATRIX

Norm
hadoop jar mult.jar mult.NormMatrix HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER
