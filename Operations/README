Operations Version 1.2 2015-06-14


What is it?
-----------

Operations is a pack of programs coded in Java
that use Apache Hadoop to execute a specific
operation.


Apache Hadoop and Java Version notes
------------------------------------

The Quantum Walk Simulator supports JDK 1.6 or
higher and Apache Hadoop version 1.2 or higher.
Note that we have currently tested this
implementation with JDK 1.7 and Apache Hadoop
1.2.1.


Parameters
----------

To run the operations, you will need same
parameters:

-HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER: The directory in the HDFS
	where the input files are.

-HDFS_TEMPORARY_FOLDER: A path to a absent
	ditectory in the HDFS. It will be deleted
	in the end of execution.

-HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER: A path to a absent
	ditectory in the HDFS. The program will store
	the result here. 

-TYPE_OF_MATRIX: If is the left matrix (A) or the
	right matrix (B).
	
-NEW_SHAPE: The new shape separated by the
    character comma.

-AXIS: The axis to generate a 2D Chart.

-LOCAL_INPUT_FILE: A local path where the
    input file is.

-LOCAL_OUTPUT_FOLDER: A local directory where the
    output will be stored.

-$CLASSPATH: This is a environment variable that should have the path to
    JFreeChart and JCommon .jar files.


Compile and run
---------------

Open the Terminal and go to the folder where
MultMatrix.java, KronMatrix.java,
NormMatrix.java, absSquare.java, Reshape.java
and PDFChart.java are stored. Now, execute the
follow commands:

mkdir operations_class
javac -d operations_class/ MultMatrix.java \
KronMatrix.java NormMatrix.java Reshape.java \
absSquare.java PDFChart.java
jar -cvf operations.jar -C operations_class/ .


To run execute the follow command:

Matrix Multiplication
hadoop jar operations.jar operations.MultMatrix HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER \
HDFS_TEMPORARY_FOLDER HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER TYPE_OF_MATRIX

Kronecker Product
hadoop jar operations.jar operations.KronMatrix HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER \
HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER TYPE_OF_MATRIX

Norm
hadoop jar operations.jar operations.NormMatrix HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER \
HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER

absSquare
hadoop jar operations.jar operations.absSquare HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER \
HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER

Reshape
hadoop jar operations.jar operations.Reshape NEW_SHAPE HDFS_INPUT_FOLDER \
HDFS_OUTPUT_FOLDER

PDFChart
hadoop jar operations.jar operations.PDFChart AXIS LOCAL_INPUT_FILE \
LOCAL_OUTPUT_FOLDER
or
java -cp $CLASSPATH:operations.jar operations.PDFChart AXIS LOCAL_INPUT_FILE \
LOCAL_OUTPUT_FOLDER
